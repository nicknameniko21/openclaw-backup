## PRODUCT-SPECIFIC EMAIL TEMPLATES

### AI Identity Pro - Fintech CTO

**Variant A (Problem-First):**
```
Hi [First Name],

[Company] just raised [funding round]—congrats! With that capital comes aggressive growth targets.

Here's the challenge I see fintechs face at this stage:

Manual identity verification becomes a bottleneck. Your compliance team is overwhelmed. Good customers abandon during onboarding. And fraudsters are getting more sophisticated.

The typical result? 15-20% customer abandonment and $500K+ in annual fraud losses.

We helped [Similar Fintech] scale without those problems:
✓ Verification time: 3 days → 5 seconds
✓ Fraud caught: $2M in first 90 days
✓ Customer abandonment: Down 60%

Worth a brief conversation to see how this could work for [Company]'s growth plans?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — Here's how [Similar Fintech] implemented us in 2 weeks: [case study link]
```

**Variant B (Social Proof):**
```
Hi [First Name],

[Competitor/Peer Company] just switched to AI-powered identity verification. Here's why:

They were processing [X] verifications/month manually. The team was drowning. Fraud was slipping through. Customer complaints were piling up.

After implementing AI Identity Pro:
📊 99.7% fraud detection accuracy
📊 4.8 second average verification time
📊 40 hours/week saved on manual review

"We should have done this 6 months ago." — [CTO Name]

[Company] is at a similar scale. I think you'd see the same results.

Interested in a quick call to explore this?

[Your Name]
```

**Variant C (Direct):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Quick question: How is [Company] handling identity verification at scale?

We built AI Identity Pro to help fintechs:
• Verify identities in under 5 seconds
• Catch 99.7% of fraud automatically
• Scale without adding compliance headcount

Worth a 15-minute conversation next week?

Tuesday or Thursday work?

AI Identity Pro
```

### Meetily Pro - Remote Operations Lead

**Variant A (Problem-First):**
```
Hi [First Name],

Managing [team size] remote employees across time zones is no small feat.

Here's what I hear from remote ops leaders like yourself:

Meetings are eating your team's productivity. Everyone's in back-to-back Zoom calls. Notes are scattered. Action items fall through the cracks. And async communication is a constant struggle.

The result? Your team loses 8-10 hours/week per person on meeting admin instead of actual work.

We helped [Similar Company] solve this with AI meeting notes:
✓ 8.3 hours saved per person per week
✓ 100% of action items tracked and completed
✓ Meeting history searchable in seconds

Worth a brief conversation to see if this fits [Company]'s remote workflow?

Best,
[Your Name]

P.S. — Here's our guide to async meeting practices: [link]
```

**Variant B (Social Proof):**
```
Hi [First Name],

[Similar Remote Company] was drowning in meeting overhead.

50-person team, fully distributed, 30+ hours of meetings per person per week. Documentation was a mess. Decisions were forgotten. Projects stalled.

After implementing Meetily Pro:
📊 8+ hours/week saved per person
📊 40% increase in action item completion
📊 Meeting history fully searchable

"It's like having an EA for every meeting." — [VP Ops Name]

[Company] has a similar distributed setup. I think you'd see comparable productivity gains.

Interested in a quick demo?

[Your Name]
```

**Variant C (Direct):**
```
Hi [First Name],

I'll be direct: I'd like to show you Meetily Pro.

We help remote teams eliminate meeting busywork:
• AI transcription with 95%+ accuracy
• Automatic meeting summaries and action items
• Search across all meeting history
• Integrations with Slack, Notion, Asana

Worth a 15-minute demo next week?

Tuesday or Thursday work?
