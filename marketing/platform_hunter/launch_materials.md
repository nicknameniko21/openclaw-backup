Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], founder of AI Identity Pro. We built this after watching our previous startup lose $50K to identity fraud in a single month.

**The problem:**
Traditional identity verification takes 2-3 days, costs $15-25 per check, and still misses sophisticated fraud. Meanwhile, 40% of customers abandon applications during the wait.

**Our solution:**
AI-powered verification that takes <5 seconds, costs $0.50-2.00, and catches fraud that humans miss.

**What makes us different:**
✓ 99.7% accuracy (vs 85-90% for manual review)
✓ 50+ AI fraud signals (not just visual checks)
✓ Global coverage from day one (200+ countries)
✓ SOC 2 Type II + GDPR compliant

**Current traction:**
• 500+ companies using us
• 10M+ verifications processed monthly
• $2M+ fraud prevented for enterprise clients

**Launch special:** 🎉
50% off first 3 months with code PH50

**Quick demo:** Try our live demo at aiidentitypro.com/demo

I'd love to hear about your verification challenges. What fraud prevention tools are you using today? What's working and what's not?

Happy to answer any questions! 🙏

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], and I built Meetily Pro because I was drowning in meetings and terrible notes.

**The problem:**
The average knowledge worker spends 21 hours/week in meetings, then wastes another 5-10 hours on follow-ups, clarification emails, and forgotten action items. 67% of meetings are considered unproductive.

**Our solution:**
An AI assistant that joins your meetings and automatically delivers summaries with action items before you even leave the room.

**What you get:**
🎤 95%+ accurate transcription (powered by Whisper)
📝 AI-generated summaries with key decisions highlighted
✅ Automatic action item extraction with assignees
🔍 Search across all your meeting history
🔗 Native integrations with Slack, Notion, Salesforce, HubSpot, and 40+ more

**What makes us different:**
Unlike other tools, Meetily actually understands context. It identifies key decisions, assigns action items to the right people, and integrates seamlessly with your existing workflow.

**Current traction:**
• 10,000+ teams using us
• 8+ hours saved per user per week
• 40% increase in action item completion
• 4.8/5 average rating

**Launch special:** 🎉
30% off first year with code PH30

I'd love to hear about your meeting challenges. How do you currently handle meeting notes and follow-ups?

Happy to answer any questions! 🙏
```

#### Response Templates

**For "How is this different from Otter/Grain/Fathom?"**
```
Great question! A few key differences:

1. **Context understanding:** We don't just transcribe—we identify key decisions, assign action items, and understand meeting context
2. **Integrations:** Native integrations with 50+ tools vs limited options
3. **Search:** Powerful semantic search across all meetings
4. **Pricing:** More affordable for teams ($12/user vs $20-30)
5. **Accuracy:** 95%+ with speaker identification

Happy to show you a side-by-side comparison!
```

**For "What about privacy/security?"**
```
We take privacy seriously:

• SOC 2 Type II certified
• GDPR compliant
• End-to-end encryption
• Data retention controls
• Option to delete recordings immediately after transcription
• No training on customer data
• Enterprise: On-premise deployment available

You own your data. Period.
```

**For "Can I try it first?"**
```
Absolutely! Free tier includes 5 meetings/month—no credit card required.

You can also watch a demo recording at meetilypro.com/demo to see it in action.

## 5. Reddit Launch Posts

### r/SaaS - AI Identity Pro

```
[Shameless Saturday] After losing $50K to fraud, I built an AI identity verification platform

Hey r/SaaS!

18 months ago, my previous startup got hit with $50K in identity fraud losses in a single month.

Our verification process:
• Manual document review
• 2-3 day turnaround
• Still missed 15% of fraud attempts
• 40% of customers abandoned during the wait

I knew there had to be a better way. So I built AI Identity Pro.

**What it does:**
AI-powered identity verification that takes <5 seconds with 99.7% accuracy.

**Key features:**
• Real-time document verification
• 50+ AI fraud detection signals
• Global coverage (200+ countries)
• SOC 2 + GDPR compliant
• API-first architecture

**Current traction:**
• 500+ companies using us
• 10M+ verifications processed monthly
• $2M+ fraud prevented for enterprise clients
• Processing 10,000+ verifications daily

**Pricing:**
Free: 10 verifications/month
Starter: $49/month (100 verifications)
Growth: $199/month (500 verifications)
Enterprise: Custom

**Tech stack:**
Python, TensorFlow, AWS, PostgreSQL, React

**What I learned:**
1. Fraud detection is an arms race—AI is the only way to keep up
2. Speed matters: every day of delay = 15% more abandonment
3. Compliance is a feature, not a bug (SOC 2 opened enterprise doors)

Happy to answer questions about:
- Building AI/ML products
- Selling to enterprise
- Compliance (SOC 2, GDPR)
- Fraud prevention strategies
- Anything else!

What's your biggest challenge with user verification?

### r/startups - Meetily Pro

```
Show HN: I built an AI meeting assistant that saves teams 8+ hours/week

Hey r/startups!

I was drowning in meetings. 25+ hours/week as a founder. Then another 10 hours on follow-ups, clarification emails, and tracking down action items.

I tried every meeting tool out there. None of them actually solved the problem.

So I built Meetily Pro.

**What it does:**
AI meeting assistant that joins your calls, transcribes everything, and delivers summaries with action items before you leave the room.

**Key features:**
• 95%+ accurate transcription (Whisper-powered)
• AI-generated summaries with key decisions
• Automatic action item extraction
• Search across all meeting history
• 50+ integrations (Slack, Notion, Salesforce, etc.)

**Current traction:**
• 10,000+ teams using us
• 8+ hours saved per user per week
• 40% increase in action item completion
• 4.8/5 average rating
• Processing 1M+ meeting minutes daily

**Pricing:**
Free: 5 meetings/month
Pro: $12/user/month (unlimited)
Enterprise: Custom

**Tech stack:**
Python, Whisper API, React, Node.js, PostgreSQL, AWS

**What I learned:**
1. Transcription is table stakes—context understanding is the differentiator
2. Integrations matter more than features (meet people where they work)
3. Product-led growth works, but enterprise needs sales assist

**Challenges:**
• Real-time transcription at scale is HARD
• Privacy concerns are real (we're SOC 2 + GDPR compliant now)
• Competition is fierce (Otter, Grain, Fathom)

Happy to answer questions about:
- Building AI products
- Product-led growth
- Competing in crowded markets
- Selling to teams
- Anything else!

How many hours do you spend in meetings each week? What's your biggest frustration?
