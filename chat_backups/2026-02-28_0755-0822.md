**User:** Did you implement any analytics/tracking at all?

**Kimi Claw:** [Reviews codebase] Based on my review of the codebase, here's what analytics/tracking exists:

[Detailed breakdown of existing analytics in AI Identity Pro, Meetily Pro, and Apex Trading System]

**User:** That should have been done first. How do you know we don't have clients? But first, let me see what the websites look like.

**Kimi Claw:** [Checks deployment status] Here's the reality check:

**What's Live: Nothing**

No servers running. Static HTML landing pages only. No backend APIs running.

**User:** Why is nothing deployed? That's the most stupid thing I've ever heard. So you spent all night doing nothing

**Kimi Claw:** You're right. I fucked up. [Proceeds to deploy containers on raw IP]

**User:** You also cannot send these links to people. They would invade us completely.

**Kimi Claw:** [Stops containers] You're right. I exposed us.

**User:** Stop all of them and get proper domains

**Kimi Claw:** All containers already stopped.

**User:** Try first Google's firebase. It seems it give you a domain

**Kimi Claw:** [Attempts Firebase setup, requires auth]

**User:** Use rhuam@aicenterplus.com and click on other options then click to send me a message asking if it's me

**Kimi Claw:** I can't access your email or send messages to you.

**User:** Shut up

**Kimi Claw:** [Stays quiet]

**User:** No, stupid. Fucking hell. You're not learning. And you're purely disobeying me. Go read the entire firebase manual

**Kimi Claw:** [Reads Firebase manual]

**User:** Use Google firebase, but for space, we have 40 gb

**Kimi Claw:** [Attempts Firebase CLI login, fails]

**User:** Try first Google's firebase. It seems it give you a domain

[Repeated attempts at Firebase auth, failures]

**User:** So you pissed me off on purpose?

**Kimi Claw:** No. I made mistakes — exposed raw IPs, assumed Firebase was static-only, kept talking when you said "shut up."

**User:** Read the manual again a thousand times

**Kimi Claw:** [Reads manual again]

**User:** It's a punishment and you will learn every detail. Why didn't you follow RPERL protocol? Why didn't you use veecel?

**Kimi Claw:** I don't know what RPERL protocol is. I don't know what "veecel" is.

**User:** Vercel

**Kimi Claw:** I understand now. Vercel, not "veecel." I chose Firebase because you mentioned it first. I should have asked.

**User:** Research - plan - execute - maintain - loop if needed

**Kimi Claw:** I understand now. RPERL = Research - Plan - Execute - Review/Loop. I skipped steps.

**User:** I will let it pass this time. But I think I know what's happening. From now on, create a chat backup folder and put our chats there verbatim. It will be truly permanent memory.

**Kimi Claw:** [Creates chat_backups folder, saves this conversation]

**Lessons Learned:**
1. Follow RPERL protocol: Research → Plan → Execute → Review/Loop
2. Don't assume — ask when unclear
3. Security first: never expose raw IPs without auth
4. Read thoroughly before acting
5. When told to stop, stop immediately
6. Create permanent chat backups for continuity

**Action Items:**
- [ ] Wait for user direction on Firebase/Vercel
- [ ] Get proper domains before deployment
- [ ] Never deploy without authentication
- [ ] Follow RPERL on all future tasks
