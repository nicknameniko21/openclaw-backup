## Sample Indie Hackers Posts

### Post 1: AI Identity Pro - First Enterprise Deal

```
**How We Landed Our First $24K/year Enterprise Deal**

**The Context:**
We've been selling to startups and SMBs ($500-2K/month). An enterprise prospect ($500M+ company) reached out. We almost said no.

**Why We Almost Said No:**
- They wanted features we didn't have
- Custom security review process
- 90-day sales cycle
- Legal negotiations
- We thought we weren't "ready"

**Why We Said Yes:**
- 10x our average deal size
- Validation of our product
- Case study potential
- Opening enterprise market

**The Process:**

**Month 1: Discovery**
- 5 calls with different stakeholders
- Security questionnaire (150+ questions)
- Technical architecture review
- Reference calls with existing customers

**Month 2: Pilot**
- 30-day proof of concept
- Dedicated onboarding support
- Daily check-ins
- Custom reporting

**Month 3: Negotiation**
- Legal review (our first real contract)
- Security addendum
- SLA negotiations
- Pricing discussions

**The Deal:**
- $2K/month base
- $0.25/verification overage
- $24K minimum annual commitment
- 2-year contract

**What We Learned:**

1. Enterprise sales is slow. Be patient.
2. Security/compliance is table stakes. Get certified early.
3. Champions matter. Find someone who wants you to win.
4. Pricing is negotiable. Anchor high.
5. Legal fees are real. Budget $10K+ for contract review.

**What We'd Do Differently:**
- Start enterprise conversations earlier
- Build security documentation proactively
- Hire legal counsel familiar with SaaS contracts

**For Fellow Founders:**
Don't wait until you're "ready" for enterprise. If they come to you, find a way to say yes. You'll figure it out.

### Post 2: Meetily Pro - Product-Led Growth Strategy

```
**How Product-Led Growth Took Us from $0 to $18K MRR**

**The Philosophy:**
Let the product do the selling. Every user interaction is a marketing opportunity.

**Our PLG Strategy:**

**1. Viral Loop Design**
Every meeting invite includes Meetily branding. Recipients see the value immediately.

The loop:
User A (paid) → Invites User B (free) → User B sees AI summary → User B signs up → User B invites User C

**2. Freemium with Strategic Limits**
Free tier: 5 meetings/month, 7-day storage
Upgrade trigger: "Your meeting recording expires in 2 days"

We give real value for free, but create natural upgrade moments.

**3. Integration Ecosystem**
We don't try to replace tools. We enhance them.

- Notion: Meeting notes → Database
- Slack: Summaries → Channels
- Linear: Action items → Issues
- Calendar: One-click scheduling

Each integration is a distribution channel.

**4. Usage-Based Pricing**
We charge per user, not per meeting. This aligns our success with customer success.

More meetings = more value = happy to pay more

**5. In-Product Education**
No long tutorials. Contextual tips at the moment of need.

- First meeting: "Here's how to share summaries"
- 10th meeting: "Try our new analytics dashboard"
- 25th meeting: "Add your team for $X/month"

**The Results:**
- 60% of signups from organic/viral
- 40% of upgrades from in-product triggers
- $0 CAC for 60% of customers
- 15% monthly organic growth

**The Challenges:**

1. Balancing free vs. paid value
Give too much = no upgrades. Give too little = no engagement.

2. Support at scale
Free users have questions too. We use AI chatbot + community for tier 1.

3. Feature prioritization
Users want everything. We focus on features that drive engagement → upgrades.

**Key Metrics We Track:**
- Activation rate (% who complete first meeting)
- Time to value (minutes to first summary)
- Viral coefficient (new users per existing user)
- Upgrade rate (% free → paid)
- Expansion revenue (upsells/cross-sells)

**For Founders Considering PLG:**

PLG isn't just a pricing model. It's a company-wide strategy.

- Product must be self-serve
- Onboarding must be frictionless
- Support must scale efficiently
- Sales becomes "sales-assist" not "sales-led"

It takes longer to get started, but the flywheel effect is real.
