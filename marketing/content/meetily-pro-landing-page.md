## HERO SECTION

### Headline (PAS Formula)
**Your Team is Wasting 10+ Hours a Week on Unproductive Meetings**

### Subheadline
Bad meetings aren't just annoying—they're expensive. With salaries, benefits, and opportunity costs, a single wasted hour costs hundreds. Multiply that across your team, every week, all year. Meanwhile, decisions get forgotten, action items slip through the cracks, and projects stall.

## PROBLEM AGITATION SECTION

**The Hidden Cost of Meeting Chaos**

Your calendar is packed. Your team is busy. But are you actually getting things done?

- **$37 billion** lost annually to unproductive meetings in the US alone
- **47% of workers** say meetings are the #1 time-waster at their job
- **25 minutes** average time to refocus after an interruption
- **67% of meetings** are considered failures by executives

Meanwhile, you're stuck writing follow-up emails, clarifying decisions, and chasing down action items that never get done.

**The question isn't whether you have too many meetings.**
**It's whether those meetings actually produce results.**
