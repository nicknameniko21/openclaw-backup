## ONBOARDING SEQUENCE: EMAIL 2 (Day 2)

**Subject:** The #1 mistake teams make with meeting notes (and how to avoid it)

Hi {{first_name}},

I hope you've had a chance to connect your calendar to Meetily. If not, no worries—this email will help you get the most out of it when you do.

**The #1 mistake teams make:**

They treat meeting notes as a transcript archive instead of an action engine.

Here's what I mean:

❌ **Transcript-only approach:**
- Record meeting → Get 10 pages of text → Nobody reads it → Decisions forgotten → Action items lost

✅ **Action-oriented approach:**
- Record meeting → AI extracts decisions → Clear action items assigned → Tasks completed → Projects move forward

**Meetily is built for the second approach.**

Our AI doesn't just transcribe—it identifies:
- Key decisions made
- Action items and owners
- Deadlines mentioned
- Questions that need follow-up

**Pro tip for your first meetings:**

After Meetily generates your summary, spend 30 seconds reviewing the action items. Make sure assignees are correct and add any missing context. This small habit dramatically increases completion rates.

## ONBOARDING SEQUENCE: EMAIL 3 (Day 5)

**Subject:** How GrowthLabs increased action item completion by 40%

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share a quick success story from one of our customers, GrowthLabs.

**The challenge:**

GrowthLabs is a 25-person remote team with clients across multiple time zones. Their meetings were productive, but follow-up was chaos:

- Action items mentioned in meetings were forgotten
- People who missed meetings spent 30+ minutes getting caught up
- Project managers spent hours each week writing follow-up emails
- Task completion rate was around 60%

**The solution:**

They implemented Meetily across their entire team. Here's what changed:

📈 Action item completion: **60% → 85%**
⏱️ Time spent on meeting follow-up: **5 hrs/week → 30 min/week**
📊 Meeting attendance (for info-sharing): **Reduced by 30%** (people read summaries instead)
🎯 Client satisfaction: **Increased** (nothing falls through cracks)

**What their COO said:**

"Meetily pays for itself in the first week. The time savings are incredible, but the real value is never losing track of decisions. Our project completion rate increased 40%."
— Rachel Torres, COO at GrowthLabs

**Want similar results?**

If your team struggles with meeting follow-through, let's talk. I can show you exactly how GrowthLabs set up their workflow.

## ONBOARDING SEQUENCE: EMAIL 4 (Day 10)

**Subject:** Quick check-in—how are your meetings going?

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been using Meetily for 10 days now. I'm curious—how's it going?

**Quick questions:**

1. Have you had a chance to record any meetings yet?
2. What type of meetings do you have most often? (1:1s, team standups, client calls, etc.)
3. What's your biggest meeting challenge right now?

**If you haven't recorded a meeting yet, here are the most common reasons:**

**Concerned about privacy?**
Meetily only records when you explicitly enable it. Participants see a clear indicator when recording is active. You can also set auto-delete policies for sensitive meetings.

**Not sure which meetings to record?**
Start with these high-value meeting types:
- Project kickoffs (lots of decisions)
- Client calls (need accurate records)
- Weekly team syncs (action items galore)
- 1:1s with your manager (track your commitments)

**Don't have many meetings?**
Meetily shines for async communication too. Record a quick Loom-style update and Meetily will summarize it for your team.

**Need help getting started?**

Book a quick call and I'll walk you through your first recording:

**Your trial status:**
- Days remaining: {{trial_days_left}}
- Meetings recorded: {{meetings_recorded}}
- Plan: {{current_plan}}
