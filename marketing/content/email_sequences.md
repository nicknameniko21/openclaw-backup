#### Email 2: Feature Deep Dive (Day 2)

**Subject:** The fraud signal that caught $2M in fake applications

**Preview:** One customer caught a sophisticated fraud ring in their first month. Here's how.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share a story from one of our customers, TradeSecure.

In their first month using AI Identity Pro, they caught a $2M fraud attempt that would have slipped through manual review.

**How?**

Our AI detected a subtle pattern across 200+ applications — all using different names and documents, but sharing a common digital fingerprint that humans would never spot.

**The fraud signals our AI checks:**
- ✓ Document tampering detection (photoshop, alterations)
- ✓ Digital fingerprint analysis (device, location patterns)
- ✓ Cross-reference against global watchlists
- ✓ Biometric matching (face vs. ID photo)
- ✓ Metadata analysis (creation dates, editing history)

#### Onboarding Email 2: Best Practices (Day 3)

**Subject:** 3 ways to get the most from AI Identity Pro

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You've been using AI Identity Pro for a few days now. Here are 3 best practices from our most successful customers:

**1. Set your confidence thresholds wisely**
High-security use cases (banking, healthcare): 90%+ confidence
Standard verification (marketplaces, communities): 75%+ confidence

**2. Use the review queue strategically**
Don't auto-reject borderline cases. Flag them for human review and use those decisions to train the AI for your specific needs.

**3. Integrate early**
The sooner you connect AI Identity Pro to your existing workflows, the more value you'll get. Even a simple Zapier integration can save hours.

**Subject:** This AI feature saves our users 8 hours per week

**Preview:** Automatic action item extraction with assignees. Here's how it works.

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to highlight one of Meetily Pro's most loved features: **Smart Action Item Extraction**

Here's what happens automatically after every meeting:

**1. Identifies commitments**
Our AI listens for phrases like "I'll handle that," "I'll send the report," or "Let me take care of it."

**2. Assigns owners**
Based on who made the commitment, Meetily assigns the task to the right person.

**3. Sets deadlines**
When someone says "by Friday" or "next week," Meetily captures that context.

**4. Integrates with your tools**
Action items sync to Slack, Asana, Jira, or wherever your team manages work.

**The result?**
No more "wait, who was supposed to do that?" No more forgotten tasks. Just clear accountability.

#### Onboarding Email 2: Best Practices (Day 3)

**Subject:** 3 tips for getting the most from your AI meeting notes

**Body:**

Hi {{first_name}},

You've had Meetily Pro running for a few days. Here are 3 tips from our power users:

**1. Use the search feature**
Your meeting history is now searchable. Try asking: "What did we decide about the Q3 budget?" or "Find all mentions of the new product launch."

**2. Share summaries immediately**
Forward the summary email to attendees right after the meeting. It keeps everyone aligned and eliminates follow-up emails.

**3. Connect to your task manager**
When action items sync to Asana/Slack/Notion, they actually get done. This is where the real ROI happens.
