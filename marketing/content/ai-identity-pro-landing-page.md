## HERO SECTION

### Headline (PAS Formula)
**Identity Fraud is Costing Your Business More Than You Think**

### Subheadline
Every day you rely on outdated verification methods, fraudsters get smarter. Manual checks take days. Fake IDs slip through. Compliance violations pile up. And your customers? They're waiting—and leaving.

## PROBLEM AGITATION SECTION

**The Real Cost of Slow Verification**

Every day your team spends on manual document review is a day your competitors gain ground.

- **40% of customers abandon** applications that take more than 24 hours
- **$56 billion lost annually** to identity fraud in North America alone
- **$15-25 per verification** when done manually
- **Compliance fines** reaching millions for inadequate KYC processes

Meanwhile, fraudsters are using AI-generated fake IDs, deepfakes, and synthetic identities that traditional methods can't detect.

**The question isn't whether you can afford AI-powered verification.**
**It's whether you can afford to wait.**
