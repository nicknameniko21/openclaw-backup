## User
**Name:** Rhuam
**Context:** Building AI orchestration systems. Brazilian. $200/month AI investment. "Never give up" principle.

## Session Summary
First conversation. Rhuam is frustrated with fragmented AI workflows — using multiple AIs (Kimi, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, ChatGPT, MiniMax) but they don't talk to each other.

## What Rhuam Wants

### 1. AI Bridge System
- Connect all AIs through Slack
- Auto-detect which AI is responding
- Consensus loop for decision-making
- Commands: `send-kimi`, `send-claude`, `send-gemini`, `send-cursor`, `send-chatgpt`, `send-minimax`, `send-apex`
- Platforms: Slack, GitHub, Notion, Replit, Apex

### 2. System Inventory Tool
- Scan all software/tools/AI parts on phone/computer
- Queryable database for agent building
- Detect: CLI tools, AI frameworks, API keys, repos, documentation
- Commands: `inventory`, `inventory search ai`, `inventory agents`, `find-tool`, `workflow`

## Slack Webhook

Channel: #ai-war-room

## Key Insight
Rhuam thinks in workflows. Wants autonomy — "pass to Perplexity to install autonomously." Values execution over discussion.

## Next Steps (if he returns)
- Build the actual bridge scripts
- Create the inventory scanner
- Test Slack integration
