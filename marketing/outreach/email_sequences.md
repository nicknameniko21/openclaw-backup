### Email 2: Social Proof + Results (Day 4)

**Subject:** `How [Similar Company] reduced fraud by 94%`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note from a few days ago about identity verification.

Thought you'd find this relevant: [Similar Company] was dealing with the same challenges I imagine you're facing—manual reviews taking 2-3 days, fraud slipping through, customers abandoning applications.

After implementing AI Identity Pro:

✓ Verification time: 3 days → 5 seconds
✓ Fraud rate: Reduced by 94%
✓ Customer abandonment: 40% → 3%
✓ Team time saved: 40 hours/week

Their CTO told me: "Implementation took 2 days. We were live and verifying customers by Wednesday."

Worth seeing how this could work for [Company]?

### Email 3: Educational + Soft Pitch (Day 8)

**Subject:** `The hidden cost of manual verification`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Most companies calculate fraud costs wrong.

They look at direct losses. But the real cost is hidden:

• Customer abandonment: 40% leave if verification takes >3 days
• Manual review labor: $25-50 per verification
• False positives: Good customers rejected, never to return
• Compliance fines: When manual processes fail audits

One fintech we work with was losing $2M annually to these "hidden" verification costs.

The fix? AI-powered verification that works in real-time without adding friction.

I put together a 2-minute ROI calculator specific to [Company]'s use case. Want me to send it over?

### Email 4: Objection Handler (Day 12)

**Subject:** `Re: Integration concerns?`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing one of these is true:

1. You're not responsible for identity verification (if so, who should I talk to?)
2. You're happy with your current solution (totally fair)
3. You're interested but worried about integration complexity

If it's #3, I get it. That's the #1 concern we hear from CTOs.

Here's the reality:
• Average integration time: 2-3 days
• REST API with comprehensive documentation
• SDKs for all major languages
• Sandbox environment for testing
• Dedicated engineer for implementation support

[Similar Company] was live in production within a week.

Worth a 15-minute call to see what's possible? Or should I close the loop on this?

### Email 5: Soft Breakup (Day 18)

**Subject:** `Should I close your file?`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I don't want to clutter your inbox if this isn't a priority right now.

Should I close your file, or is identity verification something you're looking to improve this quarter?

Either way, no hard feelings. If things change, I'm here.

### Email 2: Social Proof + Specific Results (Day 4)

**Subject:** `How [Similar Company] saved 8 hours/week`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Following up on my note about meeting productivity.

Thought you'd find this interesting: [Similar Company] was struggling with the same meeting chaos most teams face—vague recollections of decisions, action items slipping through the cracks, hours spent writing follow-up emails.

After implementing Meetily Pro:

✓ Time saved: 8+ hours per person per week
✓ Action item completion rate: +40%
✓ Meeting follow-up time: 15 min → 0 (automated)
✓ Team alignment: "Everyone knows exactly what they own"

Their VP of Operations said: "Meetily pays for itself in the first week. The time savings are incredible, but the real value is never losing track of decisions."

Worth seeing if it could help your team too?

### Email 3: Cost of Inaction (Day 8)

**Subject:** `The real cost of bad meetings`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

Bad meetings are expensive.

Not just annoying—actually expensive.

Here's the math for a 10-person team with average salaries:

• 5 hours/week in meetings per person
• 2 hours/week on meeting follow-ups
• Average loaded cost: $75/hour per person

That's $7,500 per week in meeting time.

If 30% of that time is wasted (conservative estimate), you're losing $2,250/week.

That's $117,000 per year. For a 10-person team.

Meetily Pro costs $15/user/month.

For 10 people: $150/month.

ROI: If we save each person just 2 hours per month, you've paid for it.

Most teams save 8+ hours per week per person.

Worth a conversation?

### Email 4: Objection Handler (Day 12)

**Subject:** `Re: Security/privacy concerns?`

**Body:**
```
Hi [First Name],

I haven't heard back, so I'm guessing one of these might be the case:

1. You're not the right person for this (if so, who handles team productivity tools?)
2. You're happy with your current meeting process (fair enough)
3. You're interested but worried about security/privacy

If it's #3, I completely understand. Meeting data is sensitive.

Here's how we handle it:
• SOC 2 Type II certified
• End-to-end encryption
• GDPR compliant
• Data retention controls (you set the policy)
• Option to self-host for enterprise
• Zero AI training on your data

We work with companies in healthcare, finance, and legal—industries where privacy isn't optional.

Happy to share our security whitepaper or jump on a quick call to address any concerns.

**Body:**

Hi [First Name],

I don't want to keep emailing if this isn't a priority right now.

Should I close your file, or is meeting productivity something you're looking to improve this quarter?

Totally understand if the timing isn't right. If things change, I'm here.

And if you ever want to try Meetily Pro, we have a free tier that includes 5 AI-powered meetings per month—no credit card required.
