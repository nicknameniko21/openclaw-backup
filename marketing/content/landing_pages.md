#### Problem Section

**The Hidden Costs of Manual Verification**

Your compliance team manually reviews each identity document. They squint at pixelated scans, cross-reference databases, and hope they don't miss a fake. 

**The real cost:**
- 📉 40% customer abandonment due to slow verification
- 💸 $15-25 per manual verification
- ⏱️ 2-3 business days average processing time
- 🚨 Increasing fraud losses as methods become more sophisticated
- 😰 Compliance violations from inconsistent review processes

---

#### Agitation Section

**What Happens If You Don't Act?**

While you're stuck in manual review queues, your competitors are onboarding customers instantly. While your team struggles to keep up, fraudsters are exploiting the gaps.

**The risk compounds:**
- Each day of delay = 15% more customer abandonment
- Manual reviews miss 10-15% of sophisticated fraud attempts
- Compliance penalties can reach millions
- Your reputation takes years to build, seconds to destroy

**Can you afford to wait?**

#### Problem Section

**The Meeting Crisis**

You leave meetings with scribbled notes, vague recollections of decisions, and a sinking feeling that something important was forgotten. Follow-up emails fly back and forth trying to clarify who does what. Action items slip through the cracks.

**The real cost:**
- ⏰ 31 hours per month in unproductive meetings (per employee)
- 💰 $25,000+ annual cost per employee in meeting waste
- 😵 47% of employees cite too many meetings as top productivity killer
- 📉 40% of action items are forgotten within a week
- 🤷 67% of meetings are considered failures by attendees

---

#### Agitation Section

**The Compounding Effect of Bad Meetings**

Every unclear decision creates downstream confusion. Every forgotten action item delays projects. Every "let's sync on this" adds another meeting to an already packed calendar.

**The spiral continues:**
- Unclear outcomes → more follow-up meetings
- Forgotten tasks → project delays → deadline pressure
- No documentation → repeated discussions → wasted time
- Information silos → misalignment → rework

**Your best people are drowning in meeting overhead instead of doing their best work.**
