## 3 Subtle Product Mention Approaches

### Approach 1: The "I Built This" Contextual Share
**When to use:** After establishing credibility and providing value in the community

**Template:**
```
This actually reminds me of something I built recently to solve exactly this problem. 

I was dealing with [specific pain point] and ended up creating [brief description of solution]. 

It's been a game-changer for my workflow. Happy to share more if anyone's interested - no pressure though!
```

**Key:** Only mention after you've helped others or contributed to the discussion meaningfully.

### Approach 2: The "Lessons Learned" Case Study
**When to use:** When discussing broader topics where your product experience is relevant

**Template:**
```
I went through something similar when building [product name]. 

The challenge was [problem], and what worked for us was [approach/solution]. 

We actually wrote about the full journey here: [link to blog/case study]

The TL;DR is [key insight], but curious what others think about this approach?
```

**Key:** Frame it as a learning experience, not a pitch. Focus on the insight, not the product.

### Approach 3: The "Free Resource" Giveaway
**When to use:** When you have a free tool, template, or resource related to your product

**Template:**
```
I put together a [free resource - template/checklist/guide] that might help with this.

It's something I use internally, but figured others might find it useful too. 

No signup required, just grab it here: [link]

Hope it saves someone some time! Let me know if you have feedback.
```

**Key:** The resource should genuinely help without requiring a purchase. Builds goodwill and awareness.

## Value-First Engagement Strategy

### Phase 1: Listen & Learn (Weeks 1-2)
- Join servers and observe community culture
- Identify key members, moderators, and active contributors
- Note common questions, pain points, and discussion topics
- Understand each community's rules and norms

### Phase 2: Contribute & Build Trust (Weeks 3-6)
- Answer questions in your area of expertise
- Share valuable resources (not your own initially)
- Engage genuinely with others' posts and projects
- Participate in community events and discussions

### Phase 3: Soft Introduction (Weeks 7-10)
- Share your own insights and experiences
- Mention your project contextually when relevant
- Offer free resources or help to community members
- Build 1:1 relationships with active community members

### Phase 4: Strategic Presence (Ongoing)
- Maintain consistent, valuable contributions
- Share product updates as "lessons learned" or case studies
- Offer exclusive value to the community (discounts, early access)
- Position yourself as a helpful expert, not a salesperson

### Key Principles

1. **80/20 Rule:** 80% value, 20% (or less) self-promotion
2. **Context is King:** Only mention your product when it genuinely adds to the conversation
3. **Build Relationships:** Focus on 1:1 connections with influential community members
4. **Give Before You Ask:** Always provide value before expecting anything in return
5. **Be Human:** Authenticity beats polished marketing every time
6. **Respect the Culture:** Each community has its own vibe - adapt accordingly

### Metrics to Track
- Meaningful conversations started
- Questions answered/help provided
- 1:1 connections made
- Organic mentions of your product by others
- Inbound DMs from interested community members
- Traffic/referrals from Discord (track with UTM parameters)

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Posting invite links or promotions in wrong channels
- DMing members unsolicited with pitches
- Spamming multiple communities with identical messages
- Ignoring community rules and guidelines
- Being overly promotional before establishing credibility
- Arguing or being defensive in discussions
