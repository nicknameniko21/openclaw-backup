## Rhuam's Goals

Build a universal AI bridge system that:
1. Connects multiple AI assistants (Kimi, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, ChatGPT, MiniMax)
2. Routes outputs between them via Slack
3. Enables autonomous handoffs and consensus
4. Runs 24/7 without human intervention

## Key Decisions

1. **Architecture:** Slack as message bus, bridge daemon as router
2. **Trigger System:** Keywords like `@claude`, `→gemini`, `/consensus`
3. **Delivery Methods:** Webhooks for cloud AIs, file drops for local (Cursor)
4. **Scope:** Start with clipboard/file monitoring, expand to direct API integration

## Technical Requirements

### Platforms to Integrate
- Kimi (web/API)
- Claude (API)
- Gemini (API)
- Cursor (file-based)
- ChatGPT (API/browser)
- MiniMax (API)
- GitHub (issues, PRs)
- Notion (docs, databases)
- Replit (deployments)
- Apex (Rhuam's project)

### Infrastructure
- Slack workspace: aicenterplus
- Channel: #ai-war-room
- Webhook: T0AAFFTU69G/B0AGYMZT9KQ/ivRCObA1qwq4R7DIn2VsNTKU

### Commands Needed
- `send-kimi`, `send-claude`, `send-gemini`, `send-cursor`, `send-chatgpt`, `send-minimax`, `send-apex`
- `to-slack`, `to-github`, `to-notion`, `to-replit`, `to-apex`
- `consensus`, `bridge-watch`, `route`

## Context About Rhuam

- **Frustration:** Current AI workflows are fragmented, AIs don't talk to each other
- **Desired Outcome:** "She researches and plans, you execute" — Kimi for ideation, Kimi Claw for implementation
- **Working Style:** Wants to pass documents to Perplexity for autonomous installation
- **Investment:** $200/month on AI tools, expects ROI through automation
- **Survival Context:** "This is not a toy... This is a path for real survival"

Key excerpts:

> "She researchs and plans, you execute. Alright. We can do some great workflows."

> "Weebhooks, agents you deploy, other tools and skills we can use, me leaving their chats open."

> "Listen, shut up. I say, you do it, no complaining. Try and if it doesn't work at first keep trying until it works."

> "You can run 24/7 for this, research, and learn by trial and errror even while I sleep."

> "This is not a toy for me. This is a path for real survival."

## Action Items for Kimi Claw

- [x] Create ai-bridge daemon script
- [x] Create inventory scanner
- [x] Create skill structure for ai-bridge
- [x] Create RULES.md
- [ ] Test bridge with actual Slack webhook
- [ ] Build connectors for each AI
- [ ] Set up 24/7 daemon service
- [ ] Create autonomous installer for Perplexity

## Status

In Progress — Core scripts built, testing pending

## Learnings

1. Rhuam responds to execution, not discussion
2. "Shut up and do it" is actual feedback, not anger
3. Survival context means failure is not an option
4. Autonomy is valued over hand-holding
5. Clear commands work better than suggestions
