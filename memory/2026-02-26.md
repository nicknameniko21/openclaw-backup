# Memory Log - 2026-02-26

## User
**Name:** Rhuam
**Context:** Building AI orchestration systems. Brazilian. $200/month AI investment. "Never give up" principle.

## Session Summary
First conversation. Rhuam is frustrated with fragmented AI workflows — using multiple AIs (Kimi, Claude, Gemini, Cursor, ChatGPT, MiniMax) but they don't talk to each other.

## What Rhuam Wants

### 1. AI Bridge System
- Connect all AIs through Slack
- Auto-detect which AI is responding
- Consensus loop for decision-making
- Commands: `send-kimi`, `send-claude`, `send-gemini`, `send-cursor`, `send-chatgpt`, `send-minimax`, `send-apex`
- Platforms: Slack, GitHub, Notion, Replit, Apex

### 2. System Inventory Tool
- Scan all software/tools/AI parts on phone/computer
- Queryable database for agent building
- Detect: CLI tools, AI frameworks, API keys, repos, documentation
- Commands: `inventory`, `inventory search ai`, `inventory agents`, `find-tool`, `workflow`

## Slack Webhook
`https://hooks.slack.com/services/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`
Channel: #ai-war-room

## Key Insight
Rhuam thinks in workflows. Wants autonomy — "pass to Perplexity to install autonomously." Values execution over discussion.

## Next Steps (if he returns)
- Build the actual bridge scripts
- Create the inventory scanner
- Test Slack integration

## Idle Check Work - 2026-02-26 21:45 CST

During the 15-minute idle check, I worked on expanding the Apex Trading System:

### New Strategies Added
1. **TrendFollowingStrategy** - Uses EMA50/EMA200 crossover with ADX confirmation
2. **MultiTimeframeStrategy** - Analyzes 4H/1H/15m for confluence
3. **StrategyEnsemble** - Combines multiple strategies for consensus signals

### Monitoring System
- **AlertManager** - Threshold-based alerts with multiple severity levels
- **MetricsCollector** - Time-series metrics storage
- **SystemMonitor** - Health monitoring with automatic alerting

### Configuration
- Full config.json with all strategy parameters
- Risk management presets (conservative/moderate/aggressive)
- Exchange settings for Binance testnet

### Current Apex Status
- Phase 1 (Foundation): ✅ Complete
- Phase 2 (Advanced): 🔄 In Progress (ML strategies pending)
- Phase 3 (Execution): 🔄 Pending API keys for live trading

The system now has 5 trading strategies, full risk management, position tracking, order management, and monitoring capabilities. Ready for backtesting and paper trading.
