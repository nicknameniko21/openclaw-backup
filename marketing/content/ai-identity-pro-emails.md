## ONBOARDING SEQUENCE: EMAIL 2 (Day 2)

**Subject:** Your first verification is waiting—here's what makes our AI different

Hi {{first_name}},

I noticed you haven't run your first verification yet. No worries—let's talk about what makes AI Identity Pro different from other solutions you might have tried.

**The problem with traditional verification:**

Most solutions fall into two camps:
1. **Manual review services** — Accurate but slow (2-3 days) and expensive ($15-25 per check)
2. **Basic automated tools** — Fast but miss sophisticated fraud

**Our approach: Speed + Accuracy**

AI Identity Pro uses machine learning trained on millions of documents to deliver both:

✅ **Under 5-second verification** — Your customers complete onboarding while engaged
✅ **99.7% accuracy** — Higher than manual review (typically 85-90%)
✅ **50+ fraud signals** — Catches document tampering, synthetic IDs, and deepfakes

**See it in action:**

## ONBOARDING SEQUENCE: EMAIL 3 (Day 5)

**Subject:** How NeoBank reduced verification time from 3 days to 30 seconds

Hi {{first_name}},

I wanted to share a quick story about one of our customers, NeoBank.

**The challenge:**

NeoBank was growing fast but struggling with identity verification. Manual reviews took 2-3 business days. 40% of customers abandoned their applications. And they were paying $20 per verification.

**The solution:**

They switched to AI Identity Pro and saw immediate results:

📉 Verification time: **3 days → 30 seconds**
📉 Customer abandonment: **40% → 8%**
📉 Cost per verification: **$20 → $0.75**
📈 Fraud caught: **$500K+ in first quarter**

**What they said:**

"Implementation took 2 days. We were live and verifying customers by Wednesday. The fraud detection caught things our manual process completely missed."
— David Kim, Head of Compliance

**Want similar results?**

If you're facing similar challenges—slow verification, high abandonment, fraud losses—let's talk. Book a quick call and I'll show you exactly how we'd set this up for your use case.
