## Section 7: Best Practices Guide

### The 10 Rules of Productive Meetings

**1. No Agenda, No Meeting**
If there's no clear agenda with desired outcomes, cancel the meeting.

**2. Start and End on Time**
Respect everyone's time. If you're late, you miss out.

**3. Invite the Minimum Necessary People**
Every attendee should be essential. Observers can read notes.

**4. Assign Roles**
Every meeting needs a facilitator, note-taker, and timekeeper.

**5. No Devices (Unless Note-Taking)**
Phones and laptops distract. Be present or be elsewhere.

**6. Park Long Discussions**
If a topic needs more time, schedule a separate meeting.

**7. End with Clear Action Items**
Every meeting should produce decisions and assigned tasks.

**8. Share Notes Within 24 Hours**
Memories fade. Get the summary out while it's fresh.

**9. Track Action Items**
Follow up on commitments. Accountability drives results.

**10. Regularly Audit Your Meetings**
Cancel recurring meetings that have lost their purpose.

---

### Meeting Alternatives

**Async Video (Loom):**

**Shared Document:**

**Recorded Presentation:**

- Time saved: 30-60 minutes

---

- [ ] Key decision-makers can't attend
- [ ] Purpose can be achieved via email/Slack
- [ ] There's nothing new to discuss
- [ ] Previous action items haven't been completed

---

## Conclusion

**Your Action Plan:**
1. Audit your current recurring meetings
2. Apply the appropriate templates
3. Calculate the cost of your most expensive meetings
