Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Name], founder of AI Identity Pro. We built this after watching our previous startup lose $50K to identity fraud in a single month.

The problem: Traditional identity verification takes 2-3 days, costs $15-25 per check, and still misses sophisticated fraud. Meanwhile, 40% of customers abandon applications during the wait.

Our solution: AI-powered verification that takes <5 seconds, costs $0.50-2.00, and catches fraud that humans miss.

**What makes us different:**
✓ 99.7% accuracy (vs 85-90% for manual review)
✓ 50+ AI fraud signals (not just visual checks)
✓ Global coverage from day one
✓ SOC 2 Type II + GDPR compliant

**Launch special:** 50% off first 3 months with code PH50
