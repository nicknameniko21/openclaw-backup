Your compliance team is costing you more than you think.

Manual identity verification:
❌ Takes 2-3 days per check
❌ Catches only 60% of fraud attempts  
❌ Costs $15-25 per verification
❌ Causes 40% of customers to abandon

AI-powered verification delivers:
✅ Results in under 5 seconds

### Post 3: Wednesday - AI Identity Pro (Authority/Thought Leadership)
**Topic:** 5 fraud trends every fintech leader should know
**Format:** Text list
**Time:** 11:00 AM EST

**Draft:**
```
Fraudsters are getting smarter. Are you keeping up?

Here are 5 emerging fraud trends we're seeing in 2025:

1️⃣ Synthetic Identity Fraud
Criminals combine real and fake data to create new identities. Traditional verification misses these completely.

2️⃣ Deepfake Document Submissions
AI-generated fake IDs that pass visual inspection. Only AI-powered detection can spot the subtle artifacts.

3️⃣ Account Takeover at Scale
Credential stuffing attacks are up 300%. Real-time identity verification stops unauthorized access.

4️⃣ Cross-Border Fraud Rings
International fraud networks exploiting verification gaps. Global coverage with local rules is essential.

5️⃣ Insider-Assisted Fraud
Employees bypassing internal controls. Audit trails and multi-factor verification close loopholes.

The common thread? Manual processes can't keep up.

Modern fraud requires modern defense. AI Identity Pro uses 50+ fraud signals to catch what humans miss.

### Post 4: Thursday - Meetily Pro (Social Proof/Case Study)
**Topic:** Customer success story - How ScaleUp Inc. saved 8 hours/week
**Format:** Text + quote graphic
**Time:** 9:30 AM EST

**Draft:**
```
"Meetily saves our team 8 hours a week. That's like hiring an extra person."
— Marcus Johnson, VP of Product at ScaleUp Inc.

Here's how they did it:

THE CHALLENGE:
ScaleUp's product team was drowning in meetings. 25 hours/week per person in calls. Decisions scattered across notebooks, Slack threads, and memory. Action items constantly falling through the cracks.

THE SOLUTION:
They implemented Meetily Pro across their product and engineering teams.

THE RESULTS (after 30 days):
✅ 8 hours saved per person per week
✅ 40% increase in action item completion
✅ 60% reduction in "what did we decide?" follow-up messages
✅ Meeting quality scores improved from 6.2 to 8.7/10

THE FAVORITE FEATURE:
"The AI summaries are scarily accurate. I used to spend 20 minutes after each meeting writing notes. Now I spend 2 minutes reviewing what Meetily captured."

THE ROI:
With 15 team members, that's 120 hours saved weekly. At $75/hour fully loaded, that's $9,000/week in productivity gains.
