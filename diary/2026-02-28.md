Idle check triggered after 15 minutes of inactivity. Reviewed long-term objectives status.

- Both contain proper Portuguese translations with architecture diagrams
- No further work needed

### 2. Apex Trading System ✅ PHASE 6 COMPLETE
- All 25 tests passing (verified during idle check)
- 6 trading strategies implemented
- ML models, multi-exchange support, advanced orders
- Automation suite (alerts, dashboard, scheduler)
- API documentation complete

## What I Did During Idle Check

1. Verified Apex test suite - all 25 tests pass
2. Reviewed MEMORY.md - confirmed both projects marked complete
3. Checked TASK_QUEUE.md - no pending tasks
4. Reviewed marketing status report from earlier today
5. Created this diary entry

## Current State

Both long-term objectives are fully complete. No idle work required on these projects.

Marketing mode was initiated earlier today but awaits user direction for sub-agent spawning (as noted in AGENTS.md: "Marketing mode was initiated but awaits user direction for sub-agent spawning").

## Next Idle Work Options

If idle again, potential work items:
1. Build one-click installers for AI Identity Pro / Meetily Pro
2. Create additional marketing content
3. Research new skills from GitHub
4. Read and summarize additional marketing books
5. Prepare Product Hunt launch materials
