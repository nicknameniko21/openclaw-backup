## FIRST COMMENT (The "Maker's Story")

**Title:** Why we built Meetily Pro

Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I'm [Founder Name], and I'm excited to introduce Meetily Pro to the community today.

**The problem that drove us crazy:**

We were a remote team of 12 across 6 time zones. Our calendars were packed with meetings. But here's what kept happening:

- We'd have great discussions... then forget the decisions
- Action items were mentioned... then never followed up on
- People would miss meetings... then spend 30 minutes getting caught up
- Someone would take notes... but they were incomplete or biased

We tried existing tools. Transcription apps gave us walls of text nobody read. Note-taking tools required someone to manually summarize. Nothing connected to where we actually worked (Slack, Notion, Jira).

**So we built what we wished existed.**

Meetily Pro isn't just a transcription tool—it's an AI meeting assistant that turns every conversation into actionable intelligence.

**Here's what makes Meetily different:**

✅ **Smart Summaries:** Not just transcripts—AI-generated summaries with key decisions and action items
✅ **Action Item Tracking:** Automatically extracts tasks, assigns owners, and integrates with your project tools
✅ **Meeting Intelligence:** Analytics on talk time, meeting efficiency, and action item completion
✅ **Works Everywhere:** Zoom, Google Meet, Teams, Slack, in-person—wherever you meet
✅ **Your Workflow:** Native integrations with 50+ tools including Notion, Slack, Asana, Salesforce

**The results speak for themselves:**

- GrowthLabs saves 8+ hours per week per person
- Velocity's executive team actually uses it (after trying 4 other tools)
- BuildRight saw 40% increase in action item completion

**Launch Day Special:**

For Product Hunters: Use code **PHLAUNCH2026** for 40% off your first year + unlimited transcription during your trial.

**We want your feedback:**

If you're drowning in meetings, struggling with remote collaboration, or just tired of writing follow-up emails—we built this for you. Try it out and let us know what you think!

Thanks for checking us out! 🚀
