Great question! We've found that the biggest shift in our acquisition strategy was moving from "selling features" to "selling outcomes."

Instead of: "Our AI has 99.7% accuracy"
We say: "Our customers reduce fraud by 94% in the first month"

The difference? One talks about you. The other talks about them.

Three tactics that worked for us:
1. Case studies focused on ROI, not features
2. Free tools that demonstrate value (we offer a fraud risk calculator)
3. LinkedIn content that educates, not sells

What's worked for you?

Security isn't a feature—it's a foundation. Here's our approach:

1. Get certified EARLY
SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR compliance—these take months. Start the process before you think you need it. Enterprise customers won't even talk to you without them.

2. Security page on your website
Don't hide your security practices. Flaunt them. Detailed security pages build trust and reduce sales cycles.

3. Penetration testing
Annual pen tests by reputable firms. Share the results (sanitized) with prospects.

4. Vendor security assessments
Have a standardized response ready. Most enterprise customers send the same 100-question security questionnaire.

5. Insurance
Cyber liability insurance is table stakes for B2B SaaS.

The investment pays off—our security posture has become a competitive advantage, not a checkbox.

We waited too long to hire sales, then hired too senior. Here's what I'd do differently:

**Don't hire when:**
- You don't have product-market fit yet
- You can't consistently close deals yourself
- You don't know your ideal customer profile

**Do hire when:**
- You have 10+ customers from the same segment
- You can document your sales process
- Founders are spending 50%+ time on sales

**What to look for:**
- Someone who's sold similar ACV products
- Hunter mentality (can generate own leads)
- Technical enough to demo without an SE
- Willing to do both sales AND success initially

**Red flags:**
- Big company sales background (different playbook)
- Needs a lot of process/support infrastructure
- Can't articulate your value prop after one conversation

Our first sales hire was a former founder who sold to the same ICP. Game changer.

We use a simple framework: RICE + Strategic Fit

**RICE Score:**
- Reach: How many customers will this impact?
- Impact: How much will this move the needle? (0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 3)
- Confidence: How sure are we? (%)
- Effort: Person-months to build

Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

**But we also ask:**
1. Does this align with our 12-month strategy?
2. Is this requested by our ideal customer profile?
3. Can we build this sustainably?
4. Will this create technical debt?

**Our biggest lesson:**
Don't build for prospects who haven't paid. "We'll buy if you build X" is a trap. Build for paying customers who need it yesterday.

**One more thing:**
We dedicate 20% of engineering time to "customer pain"—small fixes that don't make the roadmap but reduce churn.

Founder productivity is different from employee productivity. You're not optimizing for output—you're optimizing for decisions.

**My system:**

**Morning (8-10 AM): Deep Work**
- No meetings, no Slack, no email
- One high-leverage task only
- For me: product strategy, fundraising, hiring decisions

**Midday (10-4 PM): Collaboration**
- Meetings, team syncs, customer calls
- This is when my energy is social, not creative

**Evening (4-6 PM): Administrative**
- Email, approvals, low-stakes decisions
- Brain is tired, don't waste morning energy here

**Key principles:**
1. Time-block your calendar religiously
2. Say no to meetings without agendas
3. Delegate decisions that don't require you
4. Protect your morning at all costs
5. Take actual breaks (lunch away from desk)

**Tools that help:**
- Calendly for scheduling (no back-and-forth)
- Notion for company wiki (reduces repeat questions)
- Loom for async updates (fewer meetings)

What works for you?

**Building AI Identity Pro: Month 6 Update**

We're building AI-powered identity verification for fintech and e-commerce. Here's where we are:

**The Numbers:**
- 12 paying customers
- $8,400 MRR
- $42 average revenue per customer
- 94% fraud detection accuracy (up from 87%)

**What worked:**
1. Integration-first approach—customers found us through Zapier marketplace
2. Free fraud risk assessment tool—generates 50+ leads/month
3. LinkedIn content—educational posts about compliance trends

**What didn't:**
1. Cold email—terrible response rates in this market
2. Google Ads—CAC was 3x LTV (killed it quickly)
3. Trade shows—expensive, low ROI

**Current challenge:**
Moving upmarket. Our sweet spot is $1-10M ARR companies, but enterprise ($50M+) keeps asking for features we don't have (SSO, on-premise, custom contracts).

Do we:
A) Stay focused on mid-market
B) Build enterprise features
C) Create separate enterprise tier

Would love your thoughts!

**Next 30 days:**
- Launch on Product Hunt
- Publish 3 case studies
- Reach $15K MRR

**Meetily Pro: From Side Project to $12K MRR**

We built an AI meeting transcription tool that actually understands context. Here's our journey:

**The Origin:**
I was spending 10+ hours/week in meetings as a PM. Taking notes, writing summaries, tracking action items. It was killing my productivity.

Tried every tool on the market. They all sucked at:
- Speaker identification
- Understanding context
- Extracting actual action items

So we built Meetily.

**The Growth:**
- Month 1: 50 users (friends and former colleagues)
- Month 3: 500 users, $2K MRR
- Month 6: 2,000 users, $12K MRR
- Today: 3,500 users, $18K MRR

**Our growth channels:**
1. Product-led growth—every meeting invite is marketing
2. Integration partnerships—Notion, Slack, Linear
3. Content—"meeting productivity" blog posts
4. Twitter—sharing meeting tips and stats

**The Tech:**
- Whisper for transcription
- Fine-tuned LLM for summarization
- Custom NLP for action item extraction
- Real-time processing pipeline

**Current focus:**
Team features. Individual users love us, but we need to become a "team tool" to grow ARPU.

Building:
- Team workspaces
- Meeting analytics
- Admin controls
- Usage reporting

**Ask:**
What's your biggest meeting frustration? We're building the roadmap for Q2 and want to solve real problems.

## Twitter/X Engagement

### Tweet Thread 1: AI Identity Pro - Fraud Trends
- **Date:** 2026-02-28
- **Account:** @AIIdentityPro
- **Content:**
```
🧵 5 fraud trends every fintech leader should know in 2025:

1/ Synthetic Identity Fraud
Criminals combine real and fake data to create new identities. Traditional verification misses these completely.

2/ Deepfake Document Submissions
AI-generated fake IDs that pass visual inspection. Only AI-powered detection can spot the subtle artifacts.

3/ Account Takeover at Scale
Credential stuffing attacks are up 300%. Real-time identity verification stops unauthorized access.

4/ Cross-Border Fraud Rings
International fraud networks exploiting verification gaps. Global coverage with local rules is essential.

5/ Insider-Assisted Fraud
Employees bypassing internal controls. Audit trails and multi-factor verification close loopholes.

The common thread? Manual processes can't keep up.

Modern fraud requires modern defense.

### Tweet Thread 2: Meetily Pro - Meeting Stats
- **Date:** 2026-03-01
- **Account:** @MeetilyPro
- **Content:**
```
🧵 We analyzed 10,000+ meetings. Here's what we learned:

1/ The average knowledge worker spends 21 hours/week in meetings.

That's more than half the workweek.

2/ 50% of meeting time is considered wasted by participants.

10+ hours of unproductive time per week.

3/ 40% of action items are forgotten within 48 hours.

Decisions made ≠ decisions executed.

4/ Teams spend 4+ hours/week clarifying what was decided.

The "what did we agree on?" tax.

5/ Only 35% of meetings have a clear agenda shared in advance.

No agenda = no purpose = waste of time.

The solution?

AI meeting intelligence that:
✅ Transcribes with 95%+ accuracy
✅ Generates smart summaries
✅ Extracts action items automatically
✅ Integrates with your workflow

One customer told us: "Meetily saves us 8 hours a week. That's like hiring an extra person."

What's your biggest meeting frustration? 👇
